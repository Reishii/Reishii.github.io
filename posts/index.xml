      <description>Summary:     FluffyFinds is a tracking device that can track pets with pinpoint accuracy using GPS. Other functions of our project include: a perimeter sensor to detect if the pet enters/exits this specified range, a battery indicator to track battery life, a heat sensor to detect if the collar is on the pet, and a software application to receive notifications from the sensor and battery indicator. Some pet owners have a problem checking whether their pets are in close proximity.</description>

      <description>There are various fitness apps on the market. All of the applications have different approaches in solving the problem of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Some applications go about solving this issue through having access to multiple workout routines, while others only focus on a diet tracker. Our solution for the problem of preserving a healthy lifestyle is to create a fitness social network that doesn’t solely focus on workout routines or diet.</description>
